    <p>Hi, hello, welcome to the site.  You're here and probably wondering just what this bland page is about. Well, let me tell you...</p>
    <p>You see, game developers have moved on from what we actually want in an online game - content.  See, these days they are more
        concerned with profit, profit, profit.  I'm sure you can guess where this is going, right?  Remember loot boxes? Of course you do,
        who am I kidding - they are still everywhere ruining our games.</p>
    <p>See, that's the issue.  Instead of building a game full of content and including post-story endgame, developers have decided
        that lootboxes and microtransaction stores are the way to go.  Now, some games have this right - they sell cosmetics that have
        no bearing on the game; but, they also include a feature rich endgame and chalk the game full of content to keep you engrossed.</p>
    <p>Ya know what, I'm bored of this.</p>
    <p>How about buying something from our microtransaction store?</p>

    <p class="smalltext">This site is a joke, clearly.  We just hate bad excuses for endgame content.</p>
